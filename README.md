# Flower-Classification
Here we explore flower classification using a dataset comprising images of five classes of flowers. We employ Machine Learning classifiers alongside Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for feature extraction. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to accurately classify flowers based on their visual attributes within the dataset.
